# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [L0 International] catalog — from "L0 Template International Projects.xlsx"
# (International/ folder), sheet "L0 International". Same stage as regular
# L0 (still Stage.L0 -- there is no separate "International" Stage), but an
# entirely separate item catalog, on its own departments, gated by
# rules.is_international_applicable so it only ever instantiates on a
# project with is_international=True and never mixes with the standard L0
# catalog above.
#
# Every department here is its own new Department row (never a standard-L0
# department reused) -- Department.name is unique at the DB level and the
# upsert() key is (stage, item_no, department_id), so reusing a standard-L0
# department id would silently overwrite its real catalog text with these
# international items sharing the same item_no (both catalogs use "1.1"-
# "1.24", "4.1"-"4.9", etc.).
#
# Financial Department and SHEQ Department split into Treasury/Finance and
# Quality/HSSE, same as standard L0 already does (see L0_DEPT above) --
# renumbered under their own new department numbers, not just relabeled in
# place. Applying that same "does every item have one clean single-owner
# Action-By?" test surfaced two more splits: Fleet and FM Department (into
# Fleet/FM, matching standard L0's own precedent) and Control Department
# (into Planning/Cost Control) -- Planning keeps all 4 original Control
# items (including the one whose Action-By was "QS", folded in rather than
# given its own department), Cost Control gets a duplicated copy of just
# the Risk Register and Pre-bid-clarifications items, the same "every split
# department keeps its own copy of these two" convention Treasury/Finance
# and Quality/HSSE items also follow below.

        # rewrites seed_key to track each row's new item_no (see the big
        # comment above), which means seed_key can never be used as the
        # "already done" marker: it stops matching its own guard the
        # moment the very first run succeeds, so a seed_key-keyed guard
