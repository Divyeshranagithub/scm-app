    with a same-named domestic counterpart (matched by exact name, e.g.
    "Treasury" <-> "Treasury (International)" -- NOT by department.number,
    which isn't a safe join key here: legacy/duplicate rows like "Control
    Department" and "Planning" both carry number 5, so two different
    domestic departments would otherwise both claim "Planning

    department with NO domestic counterpart (e.g. "Legal (International)",

    gets shown as its own card, same as before this change. Manage Tracking
    (list_performance_triage) keeps its own separate L0/L0 International/L1
