# everyone regardless of role -- new tender/L1 stage (BROADCAST), a tender
# closing (CLOSED), a milestone being reached (MILESTONE), a BSD extension
# (BSD_EXTENDED), a document landing on a deliverable (DOC_ADDED), a
# deliverable being approved (DELIVERABLE_APPROVED), and a cross-department
# unlock (UNLOCK) are all facts about the program as a whole, not private to
# whoever's directly involved. Everything else is addressed to specific
# people via `recipients`, so a non-admin only sees it if their own acting
# email is actually in that list -- an SME shouldn't see "Deliverables
# Assigned to You" for an Owner, a Viewer (no acting email at all) sees
# only the general items, and a rejection (SME_DECISION) stays private
# feedback to the Owner rather than general news.
