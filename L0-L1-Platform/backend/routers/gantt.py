# The 8 L1 items with hardcoded Start/End formulas in New L1 Template
# (Final).xlsx (rows 13/19/30/31/45/47/57/70) don't all anchor their bar's
# visual START the same way their due date (End) does -- three distinct
# patterns, verified formula-by-formula rather than assumed uniform:
#   ("predecessor", item_no)  Start = next_workday_after(that OTHER item's
#       due_date) -- a genuinely different item than whichever one drives
#       this item's own due date (e.g. 2.2's due date chains off 4.5, but
#       its Start column chains off 6.1 instead).
#   ("start_of", item_no)     Start = next_workday_after(that item's OWN
#       bar-start), not its due_date -- a Start-to-Start relationship: e.g.
#       3.1 (Issue RFQ) can begin the moment 4.5 (technical offer review)
#       itself begins, even though 3.1 can't finish until days after 4.5
#       finishes (that Finish-to-Finish+lag part is what the due-date
#       formula already captures).
#   ("duration_back", n)      Start = this item's own due_date, minus n
#       working days -- a fixed-length bar with no predecessor tie at all
#       (14.1's Start formula counts backward from its own End, not
#       forward from anything).
# Item 7.1 needs no entry: its Start formula already resolves to the same
# next_workday_after(predecessor's due_date) the default branch below
# already computes, off the same predecessor (1.5) driving its due date.
