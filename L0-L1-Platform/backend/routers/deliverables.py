    # Item [Assigned Deliverables perf]: this endpoint returns every
    # deliverable across the whole platform (3300+ rows) on every page
    # load, so per-row cost multiplies fast. Three fixes:
    # 1. contains_eager reuses the joins already in the WHERE clause to
    #    populate s.project / s.definition / s.definition.department, so
    #    accessing them below doesn't lazy-load a fresh query per unique
    #    project/definition/department.
    # 2. awaiting_milestone_note (below) was being called with no lookup
    #    cache, so every predecessor check ran its own fresh join+filter
    #    query -- with ~half the catalog being predecessor-anchored,
    #    across 3300+ rows that's the dominant cost by far. Build one
    #    lookup dict per project (same shape recompute_project_due_dates
    #    already builds for its own internal use, see rules.py) up front
    #    instead.
    # 3. [Queued: SQL-level scoping] lookups_by_project only ever calls
    #    .status/.due_date/.project_id/.po_line_item_id and .definition's
    #    own fields on the rows it stores (verified against
    #    awaiting_milestone_note's + _get_submissions' full body) -- never
    #    .project or .definition.department. So the FULL-catalog fetch
    #    needed to build it doesn't need those two joins at all; only the
    #    rows actually being returned to a scoped (non-Admin) caller need
    #    the expensive Department+Project-joined hydration. Splitting this
    #    into a light full-catalog fetch (Definition only) + a heavy fetch
    #    narrowed to just the caller's own row ids (via a plain
    #    `id IN (...)` filter, computed from the light rows -- resolve_owners/
    #    resolve_smes only read columns the light fetch already has) means
    #    an Owner/SME's request no longer pays the Department+Project join
    #    cost for the ~3300 rows it was always going to filter back out.
